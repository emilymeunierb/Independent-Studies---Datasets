# Independent-Studies---Datasets
#Datasets visualizations

This project identifies ingredients patterns across several different dataset recipes. I cleaned and visualized each dataset to illustrate trends in complexity, nutrition and ingredient use. Each dataset has two visualizations and its own notebook. 

The goal was to better understand the ingredient use and improve my data visualization skills while working with datasets.
